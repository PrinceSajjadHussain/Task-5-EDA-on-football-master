## Subject
Football is a popular sport around the world. Since the players' abilities play an important role in one match, we mean to conduct some research on the performance of the players.   
In this analysis, we mainly focus on the shootings. Generally speaking, we will build up several models on one sport season's data and predict player's shootings in the next season.
